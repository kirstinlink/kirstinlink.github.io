          <h4>Mother</h4>
          <p>I have been a mother since May 2010. After 52 hours of labor I brought my first child into the world. That was only the beginning. When I reach the end of my life, I will know that the greatest thing I ever accomplished was raising my two wonderful sons.</p>

          <h4>Wife</h4>
          <p>I have been married to my best friend since 2006. We have a deep commitment to our family and share a great love. We have survived many trials in our marriage and we always come out stronger. I feel that it is crucial to understand that a loving relationship is not something you can set on cruise control and forget about, love must be nurtured.</p>

          <h4>Equestrian</h4>
          <p>My love affair with horses began when I was a young girl. I took riding lessons and eventually got my own horse when I was 11. Unfortunately, he was mistrepresented when sold to us. He was not the best horse for a young green rider, but we stuck together and became an amazing team. Together we won reserve champion at the statewide Cal-Grand horse show. Later, I was able to work for my mentor, the world class Arabian horse breeder, Shiela Varian in Arroyo Grande, CA.</p>

          <h4>Student</h4>
          <p>After 11 years in the banking industry, 5 years as a bookkeeper for our family business, and 3 years as a full time stay at home mom, I am back to school! I enjoyed bookkeeping, but was mostly self-taught and coached by a family member. I decided I want to go back to work now that my kids are in school, but I felt like I needed more of a formal education. I love and appreciate college much more now than I did as a young adult.</p>

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>My future plans include, getting a certificate in accounting and going back to work in the next couple of years. I also plan on visiting the National Parks with my family and eventually getting back into horseback riding.</p>
